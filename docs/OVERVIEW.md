# OVERVIEW

This project implements **Azure cost tagging governance** with a pragmatic, operations-first mindset:

- **Standards**: Clear tag schema and ownership model.
- **Controls**: Azure Policy to require and inherit tags.
- **Automation**: Scripts to discover, remediate, and report.
- **Runbooks**: Safe change approach from Audit â†’ Deny.

Use this repo as a baseline; adapt to your environment and controls framework.
